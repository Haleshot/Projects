<!-- Introduction -->
<h2 id="Introduction"> :pencil: Introduction </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  Edge detection is an essential part of image processing that involves finding the boundaries of objects 
within an image. This process can be used to extract useful information from an image, such as object 
recognition or feature detection. One of the most common techniques for edge detection is the 
Laplacian filter, which is a second-order derivative filter used to detect changes in the intensity of the 
image.
In this project, we will explore edge detection using the Laplacian filter and other image processing 
techniques such as low pass filtering (LPF), high pass filtering (HPF), and thresholding. LPF and HPF 
are commonly used to enhance images and remove noise, while thresholding is used to binarize an 
image into black and white pixels based on a certain threshold value.
The project will involve implementing these techniques using MATLAB and applying them to various 
test images to demonstrate their effectiveness in edge detection. The results will be analyzed and 
compared to determine the most effective approach for edge detection in different scenarios.
The objectives of this project are to gain a deeper understanding of image processing techniques, 
specifically edge detection using the Laplacian filter, LPF, HPF, and thresholding, and to demonstrate 
the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios. Through this project, we hope to 
enhance our skills in image processing and analysis, as well as gain insights into the challenges and 
limitations of edge detection techniques.
